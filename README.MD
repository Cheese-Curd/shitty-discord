# Shitty Discord

A bad version of discord for discord bots, talk as a bot! (totally original idea, 5%)

## Acknowledgements
 - I stole this idea
## Authors
- [Eliana (me)](https://www.github.com/Cheese-Curd) - I probably coded, I forgot
- [Angel Bot](https://www.github.com/AngelDTF) - Theme saving, and general help
## Features
- Themes (Discord Light/Dark and normal Light/Dark)
- You can speak as a bot lol
- Cross platform if you compile it rightâ„¢
## Running
You need [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

When you download it do `npm i` to install [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
Then type `npm test` to run the app

### Compiling
uhhhh read the docs :)
